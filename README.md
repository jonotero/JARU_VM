# JARU - A Programming Language for Microcontrollers Devices

JARU is a high-level, dynamically-typed programming language specifically designed for programming microcontrollers and limited resources devices, incorporating a compact and fast virtual machine. This language is intended for implementation on devices with limited resources, such as the ESP32 or RISCV.

## Features

- Meticulously optimized virtual machine for minimal memory space requirements and efficient execution.
- Ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) projects.
- Supports functions, classes, and a standard module library that expands the language's possibilities.
- Easy to learn, making it suitable for education and rapid prototyping.
- Focus on compatibility and accessibility.

## Use Cases

JARU is particularly well-suited for developing efficient and effective IoT solutions, thanks to its intuitive and easy-to-use programming language. Its compatibility-focused approach ensures that JARU is a suitable choice for a wide range of IoT projects.

## Executables

In this repository, you will find the JARU virtual machine executables for the following platforms:

- Windows (x86)
- ESP32
